# Hyperkit Project Improvement Tasks

This document contains a comprehensive list of actionable improvement tasks for the Hyperkit project. Each task is marked with a checkbox that can be checked off when completed.

## Architecture and Design

- [ ] Create a comprehensive architecture diagram showing the relationships between modules
- [ ] Document the core design patterns used in the project (Repository, DTO, Projection)
- [ ] Establish clear module boundaries and dependencies to reduce coupling
- [ ] Review and document the extension points for customization
- [ ] Create a consistent exception handling strategy across all modules

## Documentation

- [ ] Add missing Javadoc comments to all public classes and methods
- [ ] Update README.md to match the current implementation (fix discrepancies in annotation attributes)
- [ ] Create usage examples for each module
- [ ] Document the DSL syntax for projections with examples
- [ ] Add package-info.java files to describe the purpose of each package

## Code Quality

- [ ] Replace System.err.println in ProjectionDsl with proper logging
- [ ] Add missing Javadoc to the public no-arg constructor in ValueWrapper
- [ ] Review and fix potential array bounds issue in CharacterStream.next()
- [ ] Remove or implement the commented-out ALLOW_UPDATE constant in ProjectionDsl
- [ ] Complete the TODO in ProjectionDsl to parse the spec
- [ ] Address the TODO in DtoProjection about configuring with annotations
- [ ] Replace raw types with proper generic types where possible
- [ ] Add null checks for parameters that aren't annotated with @NonNull

## Testing

- [ ] Increase test coverage for core functionality
- [ ] Add integration tests for Spring Boot integration
- [ ] Create tests for edge cases in the projection DSL parser
- [ ] Add performance tests for repository operations with large datasets
- [ ] Implement tests for error handling and validation

## Build and CI/CD

- [ ] Standardize build configuration across all modules
- [ ] Set up code quality checks (Checkstyle, SpotBugs, etc.)
- [ ] Configure code coverage reporting
- [ ] Implement automated release process
- [ ] Add dependency vulnerability scanning

## Dependencies

- [ ] Review and update dependencies to latest stable versions
- [ ] Minimize external dependencies where possible
- [ ] Document third-party library usage and licenses
- [ ] Consider using a dependency management BOM (Bill of Materials)

## API Improvements

- [ ] Make the contextInfo parameter in HyperRepository methods optional or document its purpose
- [ ] Enhance the ValueWrapper class with additional utility methods (map, flatMap, etc.)
- [ ] Consider adding support for reactive repositories
- [ ] Implement batch operations in HyperRepository
- [ ] Add support for custom converters in the DTO generation process

## Performance Optimization

- [ ] Profile and optimize the projection DSL parser
- [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed entities
- [ ] Optimize query generation in HyperRepositoryImpl
- [ ] Review and optimize memory usage in large operations

## Security

- [ ] Review and implement proper input validation
- [ ] Ensure sensitive data is not exposed in DTOs by default
- [ ] Add security annotations for authorization checks
- [ ] Implement audit logging for repository operations

## Usability

- [ ] Create a more user-friendly DSL for defining projections
- [ ] Simplify the configuration of the DTO generator plugin
- [ ] Add more examples and starter templates
- [ ] Implement a debug mode with detailed logging
- [ ] Create a web-based UI for visualizing and editing projections
